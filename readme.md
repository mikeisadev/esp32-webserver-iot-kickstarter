# [STARTER CODE] Simple Web Server in ESP32 with basic routing in C++
### By Michele Mincone on 14 April 2024, Abruzzo, Italy

I made this is a simple starter code to kickstart a simple web server on your ESP32 in C++, with basic routing implementation from the "Server" library.

With the "WiFi" library, you can connect your ESP32 to your WiFi network and with the "Server" library you can create a simple web server to control your LEDs based on the requests made on the server.

So only two libraries are needed to run this code.

Basically, thanks to this code you'll be able to run your very simple web server on your
ESP32 to control LEDs, like I did to create this kickstarter code.

(I was making this project then I dediced to publish the code on GitHub)

You can model this code to your needs creating the project of your dreams.

Make sure to install Arduino IDE on your PC and to correctly connect to your ESP32 board.

Be sure to also have ESP32 drivers installed on your PC to correctly read the bord.

Instead of ARDUINO IDE, you can use PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code.

I tested this code on ESP32-WROOM-32 and on the ESP32-S3.

# Requirements
- Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code)
- ESP32 board, USB cable, one LED and one 220 Ohm resistor
- ESP32 drivers installed on your PC
- WiFi library
- Server library
- Basic knowledge of C++, Arduino development environment and ESP32

# Notes
- Workings on ESP32-WROOM-32 and ESP32-S3
- Tested on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 20.04
- Tested on ESP32-WROOM-32 and ESP32-S3
